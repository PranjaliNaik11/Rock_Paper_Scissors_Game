# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This Python script allows you to play the classic Rock Paper Scissors game against the computer. The first player to score 5 points wins the game.

## How to Play:

1. When you run the script, you'll be shown a menu with three options: `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`.
2. Type your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and press Enter.
3. The computer will randomly choose one of the options.
4. The winner of the round is determined based on the following rules:
   - Rock crushes Scissors
   - Scissors cuts Paper
   - Paper covers Rock
5. The first player (you or the computer) to score 5 points wins the game.
6. If you enter anything other than `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`, an exception will be thrown, and you'll be prompted to enter a valid choice.
